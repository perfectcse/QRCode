# QRCode
Project Folder Structure:
Before we start coding, let us take a look at the project folder structure. We create a project folder called QR code generator. Inside this folder, we have three files .this files are index.html, style.css and script.js. The first file is the HTML document, the next one is the stylesheet, and finally, we have the script file.

HTML:
We begin with the HTML code. HTML code creates the layout and structure of our app. Copy the code below and paste it into your HTML document.

CSS:
Next, we style the app and position various elements and options using CSS. For this copy, the code provided to you below and paste it into your style sheet.
